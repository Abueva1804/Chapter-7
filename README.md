# Chapter 7: Adding Animation to an App

I’ve learned how to make Flutter apps feel more interactive and smooth by adding animations. One of the things I’ve worked with is the AnimatedContainer, which allows me to smoothly change properties like size, color, or shape over time. Instead of instantly jumping from one state to another, the AnimatedContainer gradually transitions, making the changes look polished and natural.

I’ve also learned how to use AnimatedCrossFade to transition between two widgets with a fade effect. This is really useful when I need to switch between two views or elements, like fading from one image to another. Similarly, AnimatedOpacity lets me control the visibility of a widget by gradually fading it in or out. This is great for showing or hiding things without a sudden jump.

Another powerful tool I’ve learned to use is the AnimationController. This allows me to create custom animations, controlling things like the speed and timing of the animation. With the AnimationController, I can even create staggered animations, where multiple animations happen one after the other or at different times. This gives me the flexibility to make more complex animations that feel smooth and well-timed.
